# Wireframes

## Overview
Wireframes for Meadow are created using sketch. To ensure consistency, we should use existing styles, symbols and layout components. If there isn't an existing one that works well, create one from "style guide" components and add it to "Basic Layout Components". As with all wireframes, these may get out of date. We will try our best to keep them up to date so that iterating on new feature ideas is faster as we can start from an existing template.

## Contributing

- You may need to install webfonts. Google's webfont pack can be installed with `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load/master/install.sh | sh` if you want all of them. Alternately, you can use brew and tap the font cask. `brew tap homebrew/cask-font&& brew cask install font-roboto`
